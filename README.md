DIY Book Art
=============

Your old books can be an awesome artist! I stumble upon an art gallery in my town where they sell art made from old books. Yes, it is amazing how they create and build every piece and pages into something unusual like shades, leveling, [nottingham escorts](https://cityofescorts.co.uk/nottingham-escort) and texture. From the start, I thought it’s just a piece of paper, or wood or something but it’s a book. Take a look at how they made it in one click. The art is only made from an old book and sure, you can do it too. 

Below are the sample graphics of a book art.
